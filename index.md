## Welcome to my personal blog

I am Konstantinos. Apart from music and martial arts enthusiast, I consider myself an experienced Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in a big variety of environments and industries expanding from Shipbuilding and Wastewater Treatment companies to Material Science Research Institutes, ranging in size from small to big businesses.

My most significant values focus on quality and perfection for any given task or problem, as in personal life so in professional aspects. Through the years, I have developed an engineering problem solving attitude towards tense situations and complex problems: solve them perfect within the given timeframe, accurately choosing the right means for the solution.

Through my studies of Chemical Engineering, I discovered my passion for programming through `fortran 90/95` (you call it old, I call it vintage) and decided to wet my feet in professional programming by trying Web Development.

I am able to quickly learn or freshen up any programming language or technology needed. My always expanding skillset includes principal programming languages such as `C++` & `Java`, as well as currently trending languages such as `Python`, `JavaScript` etc.
