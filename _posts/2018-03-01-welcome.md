God! I think I am in love with coding. 5 years ago it started as an obligatory skill for my diploma thesis, now it is my main hobby. The moment I found free time to test that thing that everyone was amazed, _the mix of jekyll and github_, I sat in front of my computer and tried to do this blog. I was eager to try so many things (non supported jekyll themes, ruby, liquid, bootstrap 4 on top of jekyll and many more) that after 6 hours of reading tutorial after tutorial and watching how-to after how-to video, I decided to go the Steve Jobs way, at least to get the first product.

I must confess that I am happy that the Git exists. As every other coder-rookie, I am not an exception, the whole idea even if it is helpfull, it is not easily digested! The start was hard but I knew I had to do this *the hard way*. Fan fact #412346, the hard way is the easiest! As I said above, I was overwhelmed and wanted to try everything that after six hours of work, the only thing I had accomplished was a long repo full of waste. 

With the help of friends, the extremely helpfull [github tutorials]: https://guides.github.com/ and a bit of magic from [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com "stackoverflow's Homepage") I did it! Here is my first blog post!
